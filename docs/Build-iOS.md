## Steps

> Note:
>
> Current version of Evernym RN MobileSDK is not supported by Xcode 12, last supported version is Xcode 11.7. Also, make sure your **Command line tools** are set to version **Xcode 11.7 (11E801a)**

1. Open iOS project in Xcode and in Build Settings update `iOS deployment target` to 10.0. Also, change version in `Podfile`:

    ```ruby
        platform :ios, '10.0'
    ```

1. Create new swift file and add it to your Xcode project. When offered, also accept creating `*-Bridging-Header.h` file too. You can leave the content of both files empty.

1. Add VCX library:

    VCX Cocoapods library is necessary to be added to iOS Podfile. 

    * Add the next source to the top of your Podfile:
    
      ```ruby
        ...
        source 'git@gitlab.com:evernym/mobile/mobile-sdk.git'
      ```
    
    * Add VCX dependency into your Podfile inside target <ProjectName>:
      * release build for devices only (`arm64`):
          ```ruby
          pod 'vcx', 0.0.207
          ```
      * debug build dor devices and simulators (`arm64` and `x86_64`)
          ```ruby
          pod 'vcx', 0.0.208
          ```
        
    * **Note** that currently recommended VCX versions are `207/208`.

   * Run `pod install`

1. Configure App permissions by adding following lines to `ios/<project-name>/info.plist` file

    ```xml
        <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Please allow us access to Camera so that we can scan QR code</string>
        <key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Enabling Face ID allows you quick and secure access to your app.</string>
        <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Connect.Me uses your microphone to support audio messages.</string>
        <key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Connect.Me needs access to your photo library in order to set your avatar photo.</string>
        <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
        <string>Connect.Me needs access to your photo library in order to set your avatar photo.</string>
    ```

    > Remember to replace `Connect.Me` with your app name

1. Add below entries in same info.plist file

    ```xml
        <key>UIStatusBarHidden</key>
        <true/>
        <key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
        <array>
            <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
        </array>
        <key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
        <false/>
    ```

### Push Notifications configuration

There are two strategies regarding receiving messages by an application which described [here](./Customization.md#receiving-message):

If you wish to use **Push Notifications** strategy you need to set variable `USE_PUSH_NOTIFICATION=true` and follow steps bellow to configure Firebase for iOS:

**Official documentation:** https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications

1. Add initialization of Firebase library into your `AppDelegate.m`:

    ```objectiveC
    # import Firebase framework
    # import <Firebase.h>
    
    @implementation AppDelegate
      - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
            
            // ...
        
            if ([FIRApp defaultApp] == nil) {
              [FIRApp configure];
            }
        
            // ...
        
        return YES;
    }
    ```

1. Add Push notification capabilities.
1. When selected Xcode project, choose **Signing & Capabilities**. From there, select signing for valid **Team** and **bundle identifier**. 
   Tap `+ Capabilty` and from the drop list (or by searching) choose `Push notifications`.
   New certificates and provision profiles should be automatically generated by Xcode.

   * Don't forget to follow rest of the steps for registering your app with Firebase service and including adding GoogleService-Info.plist to your project. For more details, please refer to official documentaion here: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client" target="_blank" >https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client</a>

   * Register app for push notifications in AppDelegate.m

   ```objC
   if ([UNUserNotificationCenter class] != nil) {
     [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = self;
     UNAuthorizationOptions authOptions = UNAuthorizationOptionAlert |
         UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge;
     [[UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter]
         requestAuthorizationWithOptions:authOptions
         completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError * _Nullable error) {
           // ...
         }];
   }
   
   [application registerForRemoteNotifications];
   
   ```

1. Add below entries to `ios/<project-name>/info.plist` file

   ```xml
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
        <string>remote-notification</string>
    </array>
    <key>FirebaseScreenReportingEnabled</key>
    <false/>
    <key>firebase_crashlytics_collection_enabled</key>
    <false/>
   ```

### Deep linking configuration

If you want to add a capability where if user taps on a link in other apps (slack, email, whatsapp, etc.) and that link should open the app. Then you can add a deep linking configuration as described below. Evernym's react-native SDK uses branch.io for deep linking.

* In you `AppDelegate.m` add this line `#import "RNBranch.h"` in import statments
* In `AppDelegate.m` find the method `(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions`. 
  * Inside this method, after `*rootView` is created. Add this line 
    * `[RNBranch initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions isReferrable:YES];`
* Copy below method to same file if not already created

    ```objC
        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *restorableObjects))restorationHandler {
            return [RNBranch continueUserActivity:userActivity];
        }
    ```

* Other steps that must be done are defined more clearly [here](https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/react-native#configure-app)

### Add custom font

By default ios app uses `System` font which is usually `San Francisco` on ios. If you want to add a custom font, then use below steps. Below steps are describing how to add `Lato` font. You can add any other font in similar way.

1. Add `Lato` fonts to Xcode project located here: `node_modules/@dev/react-native-evernym-sdk/src/fonts/Lato` and update `info.plist` with configuration related to fonts:

    ```plist
        <key>UIAppFonts</key>
        <array>
            <string>Lato-Bold.ttf</string>
            <string>Lato-BoldItalic.ttf</string>
            <string>Lato-Italic.ttf</string>
            <string>Lato-Medium.ttf</string>
            <string>Lato-MediumItalic.ttf</string>
            <string>Lato-Regular.ttf</string>
            <string>Lato-Semibold.ttf</string>
            <string>Lato-SemiboldItalic.ttf</string>
        </array>
    ```

    In case you already added custom fonts to Xcode project, just expand list by adding Lato fonts.

## Issues

* **Missing ObjectiveC**

    Make sure you added .swift file and bridging header to your Xcode project, as instructed in this documentation.

    In case you experience this error:\
    `ld: warning: Could not find auto-linked library` please add next line in Build Settings, Search Library paths (in Xcode):

    ```objC
        $(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)
    ```

* **Missing FS in DotEnv library**

    In case you experience issue with missing fs library `node_modules/react-native-dotenv/index.js`, this can be resolution:

    1. Add react-native-fs using yarn or npm
    2. Open DotEnv library in /node_modules/dotenv/lib/main.js 
    3. Replace const `fs = require('fs')` to `fs = require('react-native-fs')`

    > Note: Unfortunately, if you rebuild node_modules, same steps will be necessary again, just to keep in mind.

* **vcx.framework/vcx' does not contain bitcode** *

  In case you experience issue with vcx or react-native-evernym-sdk pod `vcx.framework/vcx' does not contain bitcode`, this can be resolution:

  1. Open project in XCode and set `Bitcode=NO` for target pods.
  1. Add following lines to your app Podfile:
  ```
  post_install do |installer|
      installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
          if target.name == "react-native-evernym-sdk"
              target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                  config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
              end
          end
          if target.name == "vcx"
              target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                  config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
              end
          end
      end
  end
  ```
